# Gold Price Forecasting Toolkit

The Gold Price Forecasting Toolkit is a collection of tools and models designed to analyze and forecast gold prices using Python. This toolkit offers a comprehensive solution for data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling, enabling users to gain insights into historical trends and make informed predictions for future gold prices.

## Features

- **Data loading and preprocessing:** Load gold price data from a CSV file and preprocess it for analysis.
- **Visualization:** Plot the gold prices over time, analyze monthly and yearly trends, and visualize summary statistics.
- **Time series analysis:** Explore seasonality and trends in the data using time series plots and boxplots.
- **Forecasting models:** Train and evaluate different forecasting models, such as linear regression and exponential smoothing.
- **Model comparison:** Compare the performance of different models using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
- **Predictions:** Generate forecasts for future gold prices and visualize the predicted values with confidence intervals.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib statsmodels`
2. Load your gold price data into a CSV file and update the file path in the code.
3. Run the code in a Python environment to perform data analysis, visualization, and forecasting.

## Results

The Gold Price Forecasting Toolkit provides valuable insights into gold price trends and accurate forecasts for future prices. By analyzing historical data and applying forecasting models, users can make informed decisions and strategies related to gold investments. The toolkit's visualization capabilities help identify patterns and anomalies in the data, enabling users to understand the market dynamics better. The forecasting models offer accurate predictions, allowing users to anticipate gold price fluctuations and make timely investment decisions.
